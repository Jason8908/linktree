## About This Project

Linktree is a popular web service that allows consumers to collect all of the links that they may wish to share with others and place them under a single Linktree website address. This project is a remake of such a service and provides a subset of the features provided by Linktree. Users are able to create an account and they are each given a unique profile that can be filled with links. Afterward, users are then able to copy the links to their profiles, which can be shared with friends and family.
